# The Impact of Dam Management and Rainfall Patterns on Flooding in the Niger Delta Using Sentinel-1

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and results of a study examining the interplay between dam management practices, rainfall patterns, and flooding events in the Niger Delta. By leveraging Sentinel-1 satellite data and other hydrological datasets, this project aims to understand the factors contributing to flooding and inform future mitigation strategies.

## Data Sources
The analysis is based on the following datasets:

1. **Sentinel-1 Imagery (2018-2024):** Used for flood mapping and monitoring water extent changes over time.
2. **Rainfall Data (2018-2024):** Provides temporal insights into precipitation patterns affecting flooding.
3. **Water Level Data (2018-2024):** Includes measurements for both upstream and downstream regions, critical for understanding the impact of dam operations.
4. **Digital Elevation Model (DEM):** Used for terrain analysis and determining flood-prone areas.
5. **Dam Locations:** Geospatial data of dams influencing water flow within the study area.

## Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between dam management practices and flooding events.
- Assess how rainfall patterns contribute to flooding severity and frequency.
- Map flood extents using Sentinel-1 data to identify high-risk zones.
- Provide actionable insights for flood mitigation and dam operation strategies.

## Methods
The study employs a combination of geospatial and hydrological analysis techniques, including:
- **Flood Mapping:** Using Sentinel-1 data to detect water extent changes.
- **Rainfall Analysis:** Correlating rainfall patterns with flood occurrences.
- **Hydrological Modeling:** Assessing the impact of dam water levels on downstream flooding.
- **Terrain Analysis:** Utilizing DEM data to identify topographical factors influencing flood behavior.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Processed using GIS software, including QGIS and Google Earth Engine.
- **Hydrological Analysis:** Conducted with hydrological modeling tools.
- **Satellite Data Processing:** Using tools like SNAP and Python libraries for Sentinel-1 data.
